### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Set Airtable to complete Full CRUD site
- Allow User to choose between Screenplay, Stageplay, and Teleplay with apropritate act breakdowns for each. 
- Render Scenes on Scene Board
- Render Character List, with Input/edit form 
- Use Tailwind css for site design

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add Dragable Scene compnets to SceneBoard 
- Link characters to scenes they are in.
